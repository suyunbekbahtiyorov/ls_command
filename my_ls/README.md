# Welcome to My Ls

## Task
For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, my_ls displays its name as well as any requested,
 associated information. For each operand that names a file of type directory, my_ls displays the names of files contained
  within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

## Description
If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed. 
If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory 
and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

## Installation
-a Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
-t Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

## Usage
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
make
